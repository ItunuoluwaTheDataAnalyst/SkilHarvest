## Project Overview

This Data Analysis project aims to generate insight into the sales performance of the E-commerce projects over the past year. By analyzing the various parameters in the data received we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions which enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten to know the best performance from our data

## Data Sources
---
The primary source of the Data USED for this analysis is Data Sale.csv and this data can be freely downloaded from open sources online such as Kaggle, FRED or any other data repository

## Tools used
---
- MS Excel for Data Cleaning [Download Here] (https://www.microsoft.com)
- SQL Server (For Querying and Analysis)
- PowerBI (For reporting)

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
---
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves exploring the Data to answer some questions about the Data such as; 
- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the products on peak sales?
- what is the highest product sold in 2014?

## Data Analysis
This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries or even some DAX expressions used during your analysis. 

``` 
SQL

SELECT *
FROM Table 1
WHERE A,B,C = Positive integers

```
